# AI-Adversarial-Attacks

This repository contains the implementation of Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and analysis. It also contains the proof for FGSM using KKT conditions.

FGSM and framework was taken from PyTorch's documentation here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/fgsm_tutorial.html

PGD was self-implemented as well as the comparison table.
